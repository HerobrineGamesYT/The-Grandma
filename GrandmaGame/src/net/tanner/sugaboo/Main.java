		// period while goofing off as much as possible.
		// Ready to play? Click "Run" near the top to begin!
		// You can play the game similarly to the Oregon Trail with the console on the
		// right. Type the number of your decision, and hit enter to submit.
		// Do not mess with any of the files, or change anything in this box. This is
		// the game's source code, which is how it runs.
		// Without it, it won't work, and if you change how i've done it, unless you
		// know what you're doing, it won't work.
		// So don't mess with it!
		// Have fun!
